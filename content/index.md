Welcome to my little corner of the internet! My name is Austin and I am a Detection Engineer at a cyber security company Monday through Friday with a dozen side hobbies for the weekend. This blog serves as a dumping ground for any of my notes, projects, thoughts and ideas. The hope is that this blog can grow over time as its actually an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notebook which gives me a unique way to link ideas together. I'm happy you're here, please feel free to reach me at any of the links below!

# Site Map

## [[Projects Home|Projects]]

So many projects, so little documentation. One of my goals this year is to better document my personal projects so I can share my ideas, code, and failures/wins to the world.

## [[Research Home|Research]]

This is usually going to be longer form content, either digging into a security subject or deep diving into a weekend rabbit hole.
